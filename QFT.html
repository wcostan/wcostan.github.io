  <h1> Quantum Field Theory </h1>
  <h3> What is Quantum Field Theory? </h3>
  <p> NOONE KNOWS -.- </p>
  <h3> Why is it preferred to classical physics </h3>
  <p> These particles (the oscillations of the field) have a number of properties that are probably familiar from the days when you just thought of particles as little points whizzing through empty space.  For example, they have a well-defined propagation velocity, which is related to the weight of each of the balls and the tightness of the springs and elastic bands.  This characteristic velocity is our analog of the “speed of light”.  (More generally, the properties of the springs and masses define the relationship between the particle’s kinetic energy and its propagation velocity, like the KE=12mv2 of your high school physics class.)  The properties of the springs also define the way in which particles interact with each other.  If two particle-waves run into each other, they can scatter off each other in the same way that normal particles do.</p>
